One year ago I never imagined I would study programming!  I lived in China and played trombone in a symphony orchestra.  None of my friends considered me a techie person!  Then 6 months later my wife and I decided to move back to America and I started looking for something new.

My first thought...  Use Chinese to get a job!  Chinese is a marketable job skill, right?  

Here are a couple opportunities I found:

* Sell jewelry to Chinese tourists
* Tutor Chinese part time

These were not the opportunities I was looking for.  …but the searching gave me motivation to learn another job skill. This is when I started thinking about programming.  Like many people I assumed coding must be very dull and repetitive.  Staring at a screen all day and typing…

Here are a few things I learned that changed my perspective on programming:

### Repetitive work is for the computers!

Good programming actually avoids repetition in the coding.  We write code to make computers do the boring work for us.

### Programmers are like detectives

Often programmers can spend hours or days hunting down a single problem and fixing it.  While this may be tedious to some people, I enjoy the focus and concentration required for this kind of challenge.  

### Programmers work in teams

Programmers talk to people!???  ...Obviously I hadn't thought about this much before.  It was exciting for me to realize that communication and teamwork are a big part of the job.  Now I'm looking forward to meeting and working with many new people in the future!
